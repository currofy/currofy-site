## Building the site üèó

Firstly, you need to have Hugo installed. If you don't already have Hugo installed please follow the official [installation guide](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/)

### Create a new Hugo site

```
hugo new site mynewsite
```

This will create a fresh Hugo site in the folder `mynewsite`.


#### Install with Git

```
cd mynewsite
git clone https://github.com/currofy/currofy-site.git 
```

### Run Hugo

After installing the theme for the first time, generate the Hugo site.

You run this command from the root folder of your Hugo site ie `mynewsite/`

```
hugo
```

For local development run Hugo's built-in local server.

```
hugo server
```
To see hidden draft pages run:

```
hugo server -D
```
Now enter [`localhost:1313`](http://localhost:1313) in the address bar of your browser.
